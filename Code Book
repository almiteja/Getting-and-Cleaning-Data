ACTIVITY	18 	VARCHAR
This attribute describes the activity being performed by the test subject.  There are only six activities described in the data set.
		Walking
		Walking Upstairs
		Walking Downstairs
		Sitting
		Standing
		Laying


FEATURE	20 	CHAR
This attribute holds labels that represent a different feature of the human activity experiment. The labels are a combination of truncated 
words, or abbreviations that each describe a different facet of the experiment.  Therefore, the following letters within the labels are 
described as such:

t = denotes the domain over which the signals were captured
f = the Fast Fourier Transform domain over which the signals were captured
X = A variable to represent one of the raw signals of a tri-axial vector
Y = A variable to represent another one of the raw signals of a tri-axial vector
Z = A variable to represent the third of the raw signals of a tri-axial vector
Acc = accelerometer; a sensor signal that measures the linear acceleration
Gyro = gyroscope; a sensor signal that measures the angular velocity
Body = body motion component of the accelerometer
Gravity = gravitational motion component of the accelerometer
Jerk = a recording of the body linear acceleration and angular velocity over time
Mag = the magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean form
mean = the mean value
std = the standard deviation value

The different values within this column include:
